# Algorithmic-Toolbox-Coursera-Python-Solutions
This repository contains Python-based solutions on Algorithm Toolbox Coursera program.  Course link: www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox



## About this Course
The course covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming. We will learn a lot of theory: how to sort data and how it helps for searching; how to break a large problem into pieces and solve them recursively; when it makes sense to proceed greedily; how dynamic programming is used in genomic studies. You will practice solving computational problems, designing new algorithms, and implementing solutions efficiently (so that they run in less than a second).
